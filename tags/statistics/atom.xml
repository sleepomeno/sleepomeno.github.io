    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve come across <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-and-the-difference-between-all-time-great-and-greatest-of-all-time/" target="_blank">that fivethirtyeight article</a> comparing the
female tennis all-time greats by means of an  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">Elo rating variant</a> (originally known from chess). It concludes that Serena Williams does
<strong>not</strong> have the highest rating in history, although she is frequently
considered as the greatest player of all time nowadays. Obviously, I
wondered what&rsquo;s the situation like in the men&rsquo;s tennis world. Have
Roger Federer&rsquo;s record 17 Grand Slam wins led to the highest Elo
rating as well? What about players like Borg and McEnroe? Anyway, I
have found surprising results.</p>

<h2>Technical approach</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp" target="_blank">This</a> is where I got the match data on ATP matches from 1968
onwards providing the source of the Elo evaluation in yearly CSV
files. I have adopted the mathematical details of the computation from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details" target="_blank">the Elo rating Wikipedia page</a>, while I took the recommendation for the
computation of the <strong>K-factor</strong> from <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-and-the-difference-between-all-time-great-and-greatest-of-all-time/#fn-3" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a>. In addition, I
valued Grand Slam tournament matches higher than other matches
(because of the longer and more challenging best-of-5-sets distance) by
increasing the rating changes resulting from those matches by 10%.
Anyway, I wrote an R script which can be found <a href="https://github.com/sleepomeno/tennis_atp/blob/master/examples/elo.R" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The top 10 highest tennis Elo ratings</h2>

<p>Obviously, the main question is: Who has acquired the highest Elo
rating? The answer is: <span class="underline">Novak Djokovic</span> in May 2015! That&rsquo;s the top 10:</p>

<table class="stat"><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Rating</th><th>Player</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr><td>1</td><td>2335</td><td>Novak Djokovic</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>2310</td><td>Bjorn Borg</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>2304</td><td>John McEnroe</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>2274</td><td>Rafael Nadal</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>2254</td><td>Roger Federer</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>2253</td><td>Ivan Lendl</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>2191</td><td>Jimmy Connors</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>2168</td><td>Boris Becker</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>2159</td><td>Andy Murray</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>2132</td><td>Pete Sampras</td></tr></tbody></table>


<p>Interesting to see that Borg, McEnroe and Lendl (dominating the 1980s) rank in between the likes of
Djokovic, Nadal and Federer who have dominated the last decade.</p>

<p>Anyway, you might be surprised to see 14-time Grand Slam winner Pete
Sampras only in 10th place. In my opinion, his case demonstrates a <strong>practical</strong>
requirement to get to the top of the above list &ndash; or rather
a lack thereof: High-ranked opponents.</p>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>Everything is relative &ndash; being the best, too!?</h2>

<p>No matter how good a professional tennis player you are, you will lose
sooner or later &ldquo;because you are human&rdquo; (this is obviously
controversial and Elo does not account for this). When the defeat happens it is
better to lose against higher Elo-rated opponents since you then lose
less points. To put it bluntly: When you have an hypothetical Elo advantage of 1000
points with regard to the next-best player at the start of the season and you win
99 of 100 matches, you will most likely have a worse rating in the end
of that wonderful season due to that one devastating loss!
Consequently, it could be said that Sampras might have lacked high-valued contemporaries to
make an even deeper run. In contrast, Djokovic has benefited from the
high ratings of Nadal and Federer to get to the very top. (Apart from
that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Ratings_inflation_and_deflation" target="_blank">Elo inflation</a> might be a reason for higher ratings nowadays, too.) Similarly,
Borg, McEnroe and Lendl have benefited from the strong competition in
boosting their respective peaks. That&rsquo;s why I have looked for a way to
abstract the performance from absolute ratings: I have compared the
margins that the above best players could amass in comparison to the
next-best player at their ratings' peaks. Thus, it can be analyzed by
what margin a player has been able to set oneself apart from the
competition, which I consider as an indicator as significant as the
maximal Elo rating.</p>

<table class="stat"><thead><tr><th>Gap</th><th>Player</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr><td>225</td><td>Roger Federer</td></tr> <tr><td>194</td><td>Ivan Lendl</td></tr> <tr><td>181</td><td>Bjorn Borg</td></tr> <tr><td>172</td><td>Novak Djokovic</td></tr> <tr><td>154</td><td>Pete Sampras</td></tr> <tr><td>148</td><td>John McEnroe</td></tr> <tr><td>61</td><td>Rafael Nadal</td></tr> </tbody></table>


<p>In February 2007 Federer reached his rating peak and the next-best
player at that time, Rafael Nadal, trailed 225 Elo points. That event
has marked the biggest gap of the Elo rating&rsquo;s leader and the rest
of the world; a difference of 225 Elo points means a winning chance of
78% for the higher-ranked player. Well, two months later Federer lost to Nadal in the 2007 French
Open final, nevertheless.</p>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>No matter whether you &lsquo;prefer&rsquo; the first or the second table &ndash; both
tables shows the current top players count among the best of all
times, however, they don&rsquo;t really outperform the likes of Borg,
McEnroe and Lendl! The R source code for my analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/sleepomeno/tennis_atp/blob/master/examples/elo.R" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve not been too exposed to statistics programming in the last few
year, however, sometimes it couldn&rsquo;t be avoided &ndash; and R couldn&rsquo;t be
avoided! (I still have too much self-esteem to think about
falling back to Excel, even for the simplest things.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hate R and I don&rsquo;t like R; it just strikes me as very
<strong>strange</strong>. Often, the syntax strikes me as odd and above all, the
multitude of ways to express the same thing reminds of my little Perl
experience. Anyway, I have subscribed to the Coursera R course for fun
and in hope to somehow &ldquo;get the better of R&rdquo;, to grok in on a deep
level or to at least get a more profound idea as to why I don&rsquo;t like it ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, here is a language construct which is very <strong>strange</strong> and a
little bit absurd, no whatever how often I think about it. It&rsquo;s called
<span class="underline">partial matching</span>. To put it bluntly, partial matching makes it
possible to avoid spelling out the whole name of an element of a list
in oder to access it. Let&rsquo;s have a look.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><code>r
x &lt;- list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5)
</code></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s access <code>a_is_the_first_letter</code>! That&rsquo;s the normal way:</p>

<p>``` r
x$a_is_the_first_letter</p>

<h1>1 2 3 4 5</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>However, you could make your life a lot &ldquo;easier&rdquo;:</p>

<p>``` r
x$a</p>

<h1>1 2 3 4 5</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Well, the crucial question is: what happens if the prefix of your
partial matching is not unique?</p>

<p>``` r
x &lt;&ndash; list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5,</p>

<pre><code>      a_is_my_first_letter_too = 6 : 10)
</code></pre>

<p>x$a</p>

<h1>NULL</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The result is <code>NULL</code>!</p>

<p>``` r
x &lt;&ndash; list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5,</p>

<pre><code>      a_is_my_first_letter_too = 6 : 10)
</code></pre>

<p>x$a_is_m</p>

<h1>6 7 8 9 10</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Here the prefix is unique again. Hooray!</p>

<p>Funny, isn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t like it, though. Why? Because it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;obvious&rsquo;.
You need to know that feature beforehand, otherwise the fact that an
accidentally misspelled field is handled the same way as a non-unique
field prefix (both returning <code>NULL</code>) is awkward, to say the least.
It&rsquo;s nearly as though I said to the R interpreter: &lsquo;Give me field
xy or any field that is somehow similar&#x2026; or just do what you fucking
want (= return NULL)!&rsquo; Anyway, it introduces complexity and indeterminism into the code.</p>

<p>There is another twist to partial matching. Of course, there is more
than one way to access a field of a list. Making use of the double bracket
syntax, that feature of partial matching is handled differently.</p>

<p>``` r
x &lt;&ndash; list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5)
x[[&ldquo;a&rdquo;]]</p>

<h1>NULL</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Using the double bracket field accessing method, partial matching is
not the default. But R is perly so you still have a way to get that
behavior in a different way:</p>

<p>``` r
x[[&ldquo;a&rdquo;, exact = FALSE]]</p>

<h1>1 2 3 4 5</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>At least I now have a better idea why I don&rsquo;t really like R. It
introduces a sort of laisser-faire programming which I consider too
&ldquo;inexact&rdquo;. I mean, would you really want something like the following to be the
future of programming:</p>

<p>``` java
interface God {</p>

<pre><code>void killMankind();
void keepUpTheGoodWork();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>// &hellip;
god.k() // What the hell happens? Who cares.
```</p>
