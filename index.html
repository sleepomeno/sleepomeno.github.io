<p>How do you generate a random <code>Number</code> value? There are several ways to do it, usually in an <code>IO</code> context, obviously. In order to use it in a
common monad transformer stack, the primitives of the <code>MonadRandom</code> type class come to my mind. So it would be most convenient to get a
 random value using <code>getRandom</code>. Anyway, as much fun as rolling the dice is, let&rsquo;s derive a solution working for all bounded Enums.</p>

which features Matthew Flatt talking about the <a href="http://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">Racket</a> programming

some time to burn, so I will programm something tennis-like in
Racket!&rdquo; So let&rsquo;s open the Racket <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/" target="_blank">quickstart</a> to somehow learn Racket
and get an idea what the tennis-like thing should be.</p>

wondered what&rsquo;s the situation like in the men&rsquo;s tennis world. Have
Roger Federer&rsquo;s record 17 Grand Slam wins led to the highest Elo
rating as well? What about players like Borg and McEnroe? Anyway, I
have found surprising results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh, it is Pi day! To be honest, I had not known about it until today
but it somehow made it into my Twitter stream. Well, after some relaxed Saturday morning browsing I stumbled across the <a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons/" target="_blank">Wolfram Pi approximation demonstration</a>. It looks like this:</p>

<script type='text/javascript' src='http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/javascript/embed.js' ></script>


<script type='text/javascript'>var demoObj = new DEMOEMBED(); demoObj.run('ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons', '', '389', '613');</script>


<div id='DEMO_ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons'><a class='demonstrationHyperlink' href='http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons/' target='_blank'>Approximating Pi with Inscribed Polygons</a> from the <a class='demonstrationHyperlink' href='http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/' target='_blank'>Wolfram Demonstrations Project</a> by Rob Morris</div>


<br />


<p>Pi is approximated by computing the area of the inscribed
polygon and by dividing that area by the square of the circle radius &ndash;
after all, the area of a circle is <strong>r²π</strong>. Obviously, that idea is
that beautiful and so simple that Pi has thus been approximated thousands of
years ago (of course, there are many better and faster ways!), so
I decided to implement it myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve not been too exposed to statistics programming in the last few
year, however, sometimes it couldn&rsquo;t be avoided &ndash; and R couldn&rsquo;t be
avoided! (I still have too much self-esteem to think about
falling back to Excel, even for the simplest things.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hate R and I don&rsquo;t like R; it just strikes me as very
<strong>strange</strong>. Often, the syntax strikes me as odd and above all, the
multitude of ways to express the same thing reminds of my little Perl
experience. Anyway, I have subscribed to the Coursera R course for fun
and in hope to somehow &ldquo;get the better of R&rdquo;, to grok in on a deep
level or to at least get a more profound idea as to why I don&rsquo;t like it ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, here is a language construct which is very <strong>strange</strong> and a
little bit absurd, no whatever how often I think about it. It&rsquo;s called
<span class="underline">partial matching</span>. To put it bluntly, partial matching makes it
possible to avoid spelling out the whole name of an element of a list
in oder to access it. Let&rsquo;s have a look.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Writing software documentation can be a pretty dull task and is
neglected too often (at least by me). But what purpose does the best program
serve if nobody knows how to use it? None.</p>

<p>Looking at Github, the Markdown formatted <strong>README.md</strong> is the front
 page of every repository and the first (and mostly only) source of
 documentation.
Until recently, I have treated my <strong>README.md</strong> files rather shabbily; I
 would have thought that this lack of motivation originates from a
 general dislike of writing documentation, however, I might have
 changed my opinion. This <a href="http://increasinglyfunctional.com/2014/12/18/github-flavored-markdown-previews-emacs/" target="_blank">blog post</a> has opened my eyes to an
 alternative explanation: writing Github Markdown documentation is not
 trivial when you don&rsquo;t have a chance to preview the resulting
 markdown before committing! In that case the output will look
 not as expected more often than not &ndash; which makes the committer angry
 as s/he needs to push another commit just for improving the Markdown.
 Anyway, I remember feeling annoyed quite frequently by that procedure in
 retrospective. It does not need a stretch of imagination to foresee
 the negative influence that annoyance has on my willingness to
 provide <strong>README.md</strong> documentation&#x2026; ;)</p>

<p>The solution is obvious but not that trivial. Obviously, there surely
are plugins for various IDEs which can parse Markdown and output HTML
markup. I remember having once installed such an Eclipse plugin. But things get trickier as Github does not use vanilla
Markdown but its own brand of Markdown &ndash; it is not that easy to find a
way to display Github Markdown with good confidence in its conformity;
in addition it shouldn&rsquo;t force me to use any special IDE as I do most
stuff in Emacs.</p>

<p>The script that I use now was mentioned in the referenced blog post
above: <a href="https://gist.github.com/joshuamiller/6d58f8bd239df56cabe8" target="_blank">flavor.rb</a>. It is a ruby script which actually asks the Github API (!) to do the hard
work, namely providing the HTML output! That looks stupid at first
glance but it is actually the only way to be really sure of the
preview&rsquo;s congruence with the actual display on the Github page&#x2026;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess everybody has a story or two in store about Nullpointer
exceptions in Java (or in any language with nullable values). Sooner or later you will make the acquaintance of the dreaded stacktrace line
denoting that you did something terribly wrong, demanding a value
where none exists, and you just wonder <em>why, how the hell can that
object be null?!</em> during an hour of painful debugging&#x2026; you know
that? Good. Well, I won&rsquo;t ponder over how to avoid it, how to apply
proper error handling etc. (that&rsquo;s way too complicated, I&rsquo;m tired) but I&rsquo;d just like to point out my personal
favourite, the
famous <code>else return null</code> idiom.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been using XMonad for a few years now (lately in combination with
GNOME) but just recently I have found a way to make it work in a useful way
in the context of a presentation with a projector as a second screen.</p>

<p>In general, XMonad does have decent multi-screen support. Building on
Xinerama, the default configuration provides key-binding support for
three screens; how workspaces are mapped to the screens and how this
mapping can change, respectively, can be pretty confusing at first, though &ndash;
it is best explained in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/xmonad/comments/ndww5/dual_screens_multi_monitors_tips_and_tricks/c38dsfx" target="_blank">here</a>. Whenever I want to use a projector
things get pretty tricky, however.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first set up my Github pages Octopress blog I followed <a href="http://stefanalfbo.github.io/blog/2013/04/17/octopress-google-analytics-github-pages/" target="_blank">those
instructions</a> to set Google Analytics tracking up &ndash; and it worked. However, in May Google
Analytics somehow decided to move my account to <em>Universal
Analytics</em> &ndash; maybe I had approved it without really knowing what it
meant&#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, what is <em>Universal Analytics</em>? I have no idea! The
important thing to notice is, though, that you need to change your
JavaScript <strong>tracking code</strong> if you make that transition; obviously, I
didn&rsquo;t know that. Otherwise tracking wouldn&rsquo;t work any longer; would
it? As a matter of fact, it <em>somehow</em> did.</p>

<p>Actually, my Analytics dashboard <strong>did</strong> show some visits and hits, that&rsquo;s
why I didn&rsquo;t notice the problem for a long time, however, I guess it
only mentioned 10% of them! Anyway, after a long
debugging session with <a href="https://www.google.at/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Ftag-assistant-by-google%2Fkejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk&ei=xivvU6rFCoTE7AbJ54GgBw&usg=AFQjCNHiOEtvqJl1-RFk6_Q6oVWZTGRFPw&sig2=cuQ2UpUVHzSDJBg77fP0hw&bvm=bv.73231344,d.ZGU" target="_blank">Google Tag Assistant</a> and <a href="https://www.google.at/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fgoogle-analytics-debugger%2Fjnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna&ei=NizvU-u2Nef17AaSp4CIAg&usg=AFQjCNHR1yQN0Rdzn4xwMA1bTPZkNEGK_Q&sig2=CEZMIArRE6i7HVQLoSVTiQ&bvm=bv.73231344,d.ZGU" target="_blank">Google Analytics Debugger</a> I figured out the necessity to change the code, finally.</p>

<p>Shortly, you just need to change your
<code>source/_includes/google_analytics.html</code> to this code:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>11</span>

</span><span class='line'>  &lt;/script>
</span><span class='line'>{% endif %}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Concerning Github pages, it&rsquo;s not necessary to include a call to set your domain to
<strong>github.io</strong> any longer. It just works out of the box &ndash; what a
progress! It is not only right, it is not even wrong now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree" target="_blank">Point-free</a> code is ubiquitous in every well-polished Hackage library.

mathematical background.</p>

<p>So far, so good. However, you get a problem in your chain of function

<p>Unfortunately, <code>coolSolution</code> is not well-typed; this might drive you
nuts for some time: It&rsquo;s obvious that composing those functions must
somehow work. You&rsquo;d think: &ldquo;Even GHCI must have understood what I
mean!&rdquo; However, Haskell doesn&rsquo;t care for what you mean as much as it
cares for type-safety ;) ! So you might fall back on <code>boringSolution</code>
which is only half the fun as it&rsquo;s not point-free&#x2026; anyway, there IS
a way to compose those functions!</p>
