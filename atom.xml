    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://sleepomeno.github.io/images/book-catalogue.png" width="200"></p>

<p>A week ago I&rsquo;ve downloaded the app
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue&hl=de" target="_blank">Book Catalogue</a> from the Android Play store. As its name suggests it&rsquo;s
about creating a catalogue of your books. My family and I thought it would be handy
to know that as you easily lose track of what books we actually own
and where we have stored them.</p>

<p><strong>Book Catalogue</strong> makes it all possible: adding books by scanning the
barcode, by ISBN, by searching author/title or by adding all
information manually. Of course, every book is stored to be in exactly
one bookshelf &ndash; you can create as many bookshelves as necessary and
can name them as you want.</p>

<p>In addition, <strong>Book Catalogue</strong> provides syncing to a <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">GoodReads</a> account.
I was really looking forward to this as it would make sharing the
digital library with my family extremely easy&#x2026; but only in theory.
It turned out that the GoodReads API only allows books to be added if
the book already exists on GoodReads. Anyway, the app makes a good
job to actually inform you which books couldn&rsquo;t be uploaded
successfully. You could then add those books on the GoodReads web
site, however, it&rsquo;s very cumbersome to do that for all missing books;
so far, I have filed a few hundred books and about a fifth of them
GoodReads does not know. So the GoodReads sync option is not <em>really</em>
usable after all (especially if you have many old or rare books as
they are then likely to be unknown to GoodReads). Luckily, a CSV
import/export is provided as well so that I&rsquo;m not entirely dependent on
GoodReads&rsquo;s good will ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Still the <strong>BookCatalogue</strong> is really great in my opinion (the imperfect GoodReads
API is not its fault). Firstly, it&rsquo;s interface is really beautiful and
provides nice ways to list the books in various ways. More
importantly, the identification of books by barcode and ISBN really
works well, including the downloading of meta information from several
sources like Amazon, LibraryThing, GoodReads and Google Books without
a blink!</p>

<p>Well, it needs to be mentioned that <strong>BookCatalogue</strong> is an Open Source
project and <a href="https://github.com/eleybourn/Book-Catalogue/wiki" target="_blank">can be found on GitHub</a>. So I might actually implement a
working syncing option when I&rsquo;m really convinced it&rsquo;s worth the work.
Until then I&rsquo;ll keep fiddling with CSV export files to keep
everybody&rsquo;s installation up-to-date on our shared library. It&rsquo;s not
perfect but it works&#x2026;</p>

    <updated>2014-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://sleepomeno.github.io/blog/2014/02/07/Why-Blogging-Matters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is that fancy phrase &ldquo;pics or it didn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just
claiming evidence for a, more or less, hardly credible experience which has often to do
with some sort of drug abuse. Yes, experience shows it&rsquo;s
sometimes cleverer to do without taking a photo, anyway, it crossed my mind that that phrase might be
applicable not only to excess-like experiences but to&#x2026; pretty much
everything in life.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ll come back later to what that actually means.. actually, I&rsquo;ve just found a nice <a href="http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/08/11/write-things-tell-people.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>
about the importance of running a blog as a developer which goes
nicely with what I&rsquo;ve been thinking. The author, Matt Swanson, says
&ldquo;Do things, write about it&rdquo; and explains how sharing his learning on
his blog has been incredibly rewarding: Firstly, people told him how much they
enjoy reading his posts (those compliments alone may be worth it!) and secondly, he gained reputation by
demonstrating his abilities and initiative. As a result, he somehow became some
sort of a &ldquo;super hero&rdquo; in people&rsquo;s minds although his posts are not
exactly rocket-science. Regular posts (content is still king!) and a
pretty straight-forward way of expressing things were enough to raise
his value&#x2026; the question is: Did Matt just fool his readers? Isn&rsquo;t he a clever guy after all?</p>

<p>Of course he is &ldquo;clever&rdquo;. He is &ldquo;clever&rdquo; <strong>because</strong> he shares his
projects, learnings and insights on his blog. Being a Software
developer, blogging about your projects is the most efficient way of
gaining an over-all reputation &ndash; a manager, who considers hiring you, won&rsquo;t read commit logs of Open Source
Projects where your name might appear but he can enjoy a well-written blog! In fact,
the &lsquo;positive&rsquo; effect on the manager&rsquo;s decision seems inevitable; and that&rsquo;s
where the &ldquo;pics or it didn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo; attitude comes into play. In
order to convey your abilities to the manager you need definite proof,
pretty similiar to the situation in court, actually: In the end, the
judge reaches a verdict and <strong>decides what is the truth</strong>. Analogously,
you will always <strong>be</strong> exactly as &ldquo;clever&rdquo; as your vis-Ã -vis, respectively the
readers of your blog, think you are! It goes without saying that you
can replace the word &ldquo;clever&rdquo; with whatever other positive quality you&rsquo;d
like to convey &ndash; &ldquo;competent&rdquo;, &ldquo;open-minded&rdquo;, &ldquo;innovative&rdquo;, &#x2026;, you
name it.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, you will actually get cleverer when you blog regularly
;&ndash;) Strange? Well, first let&rsquo;s get rid of the word &ldquo;clever&rdquo; once and
for all, it is somehow inaccurate &ndash; what I want to say is: You will
get better at those topics you&rsquo;re blogging about. (And that not only
applies to tech blogs!) The reason for that: The extra thinking
necessary for presenting your work in a nicely structured way on your
blog will actually force you to nicely structure your projects as
well! In addition, your inner urge to at least blog once, twice or X
times a week will actually force you to pursue your projects and
learnings &lsquo;cause otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to blog about.
As a result, you&rsquo;ll inevitably get better at reasoning and get a
better understanding of your blog posts&rsquo; topics&#x2026; briefly, you get
&ldquo;cleverer&rdquo;! Isn&rsquo;t that ironic? ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven&rsquo;t been able to post regularly in the past, for
whatever reasons. In the end that always led to abandonning my past blogs altogether, so I&rsquo;m not
quite sure the above argumentation is too believable coming from me,
to be honest. However, for the moment, it is enough motivation for me to try a fresh
start with this blog. After all, it&rsquo;s all about motivation and inspiration.</p>

    <id>http://sleepomeno.github.io/blog/2014/02/06/A-fresh-start</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2014 has just started a month ago and I&rsquo;ve painfully realized that I
didn&rsquo;t come up with any New Year&rsquo;s resolutions at that time. There is
no resolution to violate, consequently, no reason to feel bad at all &ndash;
so why not start a new blog which I could then feel bad about when I
post nothing for months?! Well, to be serious, that&rsquo;s at least how all
my blogging attempts have ended so far. I definitely don&rsquo;t know if
history will repeat itself again this time. Maybe this post will actually stay the
only post for two months? Any bets? ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Anyway, I better shortly summarize what I plan blogging about. Being a
software developer, tech topics will probably dominate. Still I can&rsquo;t
promise not to rant about some random topic from time to time ;&ndash;) As
an Emacs user I might blog about my <strong>Elisp</strong> learning progress or other
stuff like the one and only <strong>org-mode</strong>. Using <strong>Octopress</strong> as my blogging
engine it will be unavoidable to mention it as well, ranging from
plugins and customizations to its philosophy. From time to time I&rsquo;d also
like talking about my journeys to <strong>Haskell</strong> wonderland and
<strong>Clojure(Script)</strong> development. Or mention some Android apps? There are
enough topics for sure, we&rsquo;ll see if there is enough motivation to
carry on blogging as well ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the best!</p>
