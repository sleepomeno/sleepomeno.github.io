Hi! My name is Gregor Riegler in case you don't know. I'm in my twenties and I have studied Computer Science at the Technical University of Vienna. At the moment I'm finishing my Master's degree in Software Engineering and Internet Computing. 

So far I've worked as a backend and frontend web developer for several years. In my projects I have used following technologies among others: GWT, AngularJS, Clojure, Java, Groovy, Scala, Android, Python, Liferay, Java, C, Perl, Sass, KnockoutJS, Typo3, Haskell, etc.

In my free time chances are good that you might meet me at a local coffee shop. Apart from coffee I also like playing billiards, chess, poker and darts and solving sudokus. In addition, I practice Karate and juggling (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOhAXUTnvE" target="_blank">this</a> is still the dream...). What I don't like: pessimism and slow passersby.

You can find me on github as [sleepomeno](https://github.com/sleepomeno "sleepomeno") and could follow me on Twitter.
