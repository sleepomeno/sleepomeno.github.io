Hi! My name is Gregor Riegler in case you don't know. I'm a software
engineer in my twenties. I received a master's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Vienna.

So far I've worked as a backend and frontend web developer for several
years. In my projects I have used following technologies among others:
Haskell, PureScript, GWT, AngularJS, Clojure, Java, Groovy, Scala,
Android, Python, Liferay, Java, Perl, Sass, KnockoutJS, Typo3, etc.
It's not a secret that I have a bias for unusual, bleeding-edge
technologies. I especially prefer functional programming in languages
like Haskell, PureScript or Clojure. I regularly give talks about
topics arising in the functional programming world in local tech
meetups (see <a href="../presentations/lambdaheads-purescript.html"
target="_blank">this</a> or <a
href="../presentations/lambdaheads-frp.html" target="_blank">that</a>).

In my free time chances are good that you might meet me at a local
coffee shop. Apart from coffee I also like playing billiards, chess,
poker and darts and solving sudokus. In addition, I practice juggling (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOhAXUTnvE" target="_blank">this</a> is still the dream...). What I don't like: pessimism and slow passersby.

You can find me on GitHub as [sleepomeno](https://github.com/sleepomeno "sleepomeno") and could follow me on Twitter.
