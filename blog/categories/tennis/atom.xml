    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2 hours to go&#x2026; I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the men&rsquo;s tennis US Open final
to start. What should I do? In the end, I&rsquo;ve been killing time listening to <a href="http://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-24-matthew-flatt/" target="_blank">that</a> Functional Geekery podcast episode
which features Matthew Flatt talking about the <a href="http://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">Racket</a> programming
language. Realizing the irony, my thoughts went something like: &ldquo;Racket, tennis?! Can&rsquo;t be a coincidence! Still
some time to burn, so I will programm something tennis-like in
Racket!&rdquo; So let&rsquo;s open the Racket <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/" target="_blank">quickstart</a> to somehow learn Racket
and get an idea what the tennis-like thing should be.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/court.png" width="200"></p>

<p>The idea came instantly when I saw that Racket offers quite
newbie-friendly picture drawing examples in its tutorial. Now, it&rsquo;s
obvious what I would do, isn&rsquo;t it? Exactly, I would draw a tennis
court! So I <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">downloaded</a> Racket and found the executable
for the Racket IDE DrRacket in the <strong>bin</strong> folder of the resulting
directory. Given the examples of the <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/" target="_blank">quickstart</a> tutorial I could come
up with that code which got the job done. And it even has (kind of) the blue
color of the US Open hard court ;)</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>(frame (frame (vc-append margin doubles middles doubles) #:color "white" #:line-width 18) #:color color #:line-width 12))
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The code can also be found in that <a href="https://gist.github.com/sleepomeno/f8f0af59b19324166619" target="_blank">gist</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, now the final is about to start, so only a few impressions of
using Racket for the first time: DrRacket proved easy to use and the
<a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/pict/Basic_Pict_Constructors.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> made it easy to find the right functions for drawing. It
was quite pleasant to see that I could get things done in Racket even
under severe time pressure ;)</p>

<p>Go, Federer!</p>

    <updated>2015-09-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://sleepomeno.github.io/blog/2015/09/08/Historical-ELO-Tennis-Rating</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve come across <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-and-the-difference-between-all-time-great-and-greatest-of-all-time/" target="_blank">that fivethirtyeight article</a> comparing the
female tennis all-time greats by means of an  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">Elo rating variant</a> (originally known from chess). It concludes that Serena Williams does
<strong>not</strong> have the highest rating in history, although she is frequently
considered as the greatest player of all time nowadays. Obviously, I
wondered what&rsquo;s the situation like in the men&rsquo;s tennis world. Have
Roger Federer&rsquo;s record 17 Grand Slam wins led to the highest Elo
rating as well? What about players like Borg and McEnroe? Anyway, I
have found surprising results.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Technical approach</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp" target="_blank">This</a> is where I got the match data on ATP matches from 1968
onwards providing the source of the Elo evaluation in yearly CSV
files. I have adopted the mathematical details of the computation from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details" target="_blank">the Elo rating Wikipedia page</a>, while I took the recommendation for the
computation of the <strong>K-factor</strong> from <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-and-the-difference-between-all-time-great-and-greatest-of-all-time/#fn-3" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a>. In addition, I
valued Grand Slam tournament matches higher than other matches
(because of the longer and more challenging best-of-5-sets distance) by
increasing the rating changes resulting from those matches by 10%.
Anyway, I wrote an R script which can be found <a href="https://github.com/sleepomeno/tennis_atp/blob/master/examples/elo.R" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The top 10 highest tennis Elo ratings</h2>

<p>Obviously, the main question is: Who has acquired the highest Elo
rating? The answer is: <span class="underline">Novak Djokovic</span> in May 2015! That&rsquo;s the top 10:</p>

<table class="stat"><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Rating</th><th>Player</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr><td>1</td><td>2335</td><td>Novak Djokovic</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>2310</td><td>Bjorn Borg</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>2304</td><td>John McEnroe</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>2274</td><td>Rafael Nadal</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>2254</td><td>Roger Federer</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>2253</td><td>Ivan Lendl</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>2191</td><td>Jimmy Connors</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>2168</td><td>Boris Becker</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>2159</td><td>Andy Murray</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>2132</td><td>Pete Sampras</td></tr></tbody></table>


<p>Interesting to see that Borg, McEnroe and Lendl (dominating the 1980s) rank in between the likes of
Djokovic, Nadal and Federer who have dominated the last decade.</p>

<p>Anyway, you might be surprised to see 14-time Grand Slam winner Pete
Sampras only in 10th place. In my opinion, his case demonstrates a <strong>practical</strong>
requirement to get to the top of the above list &ndash; or rather
a lack thereof: High-ranked opponents.</p>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>Everything is relative &ndash; being the best, too!?</h2>

<p>No matter how good a professional tennis player you are, you will lose
sooner or later &ldquo;because you are human&rdquo; (this is obviously
controversial and Elo does not account for this). When the defeat happens it is
better to lose against higher Elo-rated opponents since you then lose
less points. To put it bluntly: When you have an hypothetical Elo advantage of 1000
points with regard to the next-best player at the start of the season and you win
99 of 100 matches, you will most likely have a worse rating in the end
of that wonderful season due to that one devastating loss!
Consequently, it could be said that Sampras might have lacked high-valued contemporaries to
make an even deeper run. In contrast, Djokovic has benefited from the
high ratings of Nadal and Federer to get to the very top. (Apart from
that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Ratings_inflation_and_deflation" target="_blank">Elo inflation</a> might be a reason for higher ratings nowadays, too.) Similarly,
Borg, McEnroe and Lendl have benefited from the strong competition in
boosting their respective peaks. That&rsquo;s why I have looked for a way to
abstract the performance from absolute ratings: I have compared the
margins that the above best players could amass in comparison to the
next-best player at their ratings' peaks. Thus, it can be analyzed by
what margin a player has been able to set oneself apart from the
competition, which I consider as an indicator as significant as the
maximal Elo rating.</p>

<table class="stat"><thead><tr><th>Gap</th><th>Player</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr><td>225</td><td>Roger Federer</td></tr> <tr><td>194</td><td>Ivan Lendl</td></tr> <tr><td>181</td><td>Bjorn Borg</td></tr> <tr><td>172</td><td>Novak Djokovic</td></tr> <tr><td>154</td><td>Pete Sampras</td></tr> <tr><td>148</td><td>John McEnroe</td></tr> <tr><td>61</td><td>Rafael Nadal</td></tr> </tbody></table>


<p>In February 2007 Federer reached his rating peak and the next-best
player at that time, Rafael Nadal, trailed 225 Elo points. That event
has marked the biggest gap of the Elo rating&rsquo;s leader and the rest
of the world; a difference of 225 Elo points means a winning chance of
78% for the higher-ranked player. Well, two months later Federer lost to Nadal in the 2007 French
Open final, nevertheless.</p>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>No matter whether you &lsquo;prefer&rsquo; the first or the second table &ndash; both
tables shows the current top players count among the best of all
times, however, they don&rsquo;t really outperform the likes of Borg,
McEnroe and Lendl! The R source code for my analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/sleepomeno/tennis_atp/blob/master/examples/elo.R" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
