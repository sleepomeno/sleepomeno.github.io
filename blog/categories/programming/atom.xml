    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every wanted to roll the dice in Haskell? Let&rsquo;s say you have a data type like</p>

<p>``` haskell
data Number = One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Six</p>

<pre><code> deriving (Enum, Bounded, Eq, Show)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>How do you generate a random <code>Number</code> value? There are several ways to do it, usually in an <code>IO</code> context, obviously. In order to use it in a
common monad transformer stack, the primitives of the <code>MonadRandom</code> type class come to my mind. So it would be most convenient to get a
 random value using <code>getRandom</code>. Anyway, as much fun as rolling the dice is, let&rsquo;s derive a solution working for all bounded Enums.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Anyway, import <strong>Control.Monad.Random</strong> as we want to use <code>getRandom</code> of the <code>MonadRandom</code> class which looks like:</p>

<p>``` haskell
class Monad m => MonadRandom (m :: * &ndash;> *) where</p>

<pre><code>getRandom :: Random a =&gt; m a
</code></pre>

<p>&mdash; other functions we don&rsquo;t need</p>

<p>class Random a where
&mdash; needs to provide:</p>

<pre><code>randomR :: RandomGen g =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; g -&gt; (a, g)
random :: RandomGen g =&gt; g -&gt; (a, g)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Shortly, <code>randomR</code> needs to be able to provide a random <code>Number</code> value in the specified interval, given a random number generator. So the idea is about mapping the Enum values to <code>Int</code> values
and deriving a random Enum value from a randomly generated number.</p>

<p>``` haskell
&mdash; :t fromEnum
&mdash; fromEnum :: Enum a => a &ndash;> Int
&mdash; :t toEnum
&mdash; toEnum :: Enum a => Int &ndash;> a</p>

<p>&mdash; 1)
instance Random Number where</p>

<pre><code>randomR (a,b) g = 
    case randomR (fromEnum a, fromEnum b) g of
            (x, g') -&gt; (toEnum x, g')
random g = randomR (One, Six) g
</code></pre>

<p>&mdash; 2) &ndash; more general solution making use of Bounded
instance Random Number where</p>

<pre><code>randomR = enumRandomR
random g = randomR (minBound, maxBound) g
</code></pre>

<p>enumRandomR (a, b) g =</p>

<pre><code>case randomR (fromEnum a, fromEnum b) g of
    (x, g') -&gt; (toEnum x, g')
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>While we still used the explicit <code>Number</code> interval values in <strong>1)</strong>, we get a more general solution in <strong>2)</strong> using the fact that we had auto-derived an instance of <code>Bounded</code> for <code>Number</code> and thus have <code>minBound</code> and <code>maxBound</code> at our disposal.</p>

<p>At last, we can generate a random <code>Number</code> value:</p>

<p><code>haskell
λ&gt; getRandom :: IO Number
Two
</code></p>

<p>Anyway, our generated <code>Number</code> values are uniformly distributed, every value occurs with equal probability. What if you want to tamper with the die at little, e.g.
when your opponent throws the dice they should not get a <code>Six</code> quite so often. You could do that providing a respective <code>Random</code> instance for a newtype wrapper:</p>

<p>``` haskell
&mdash; you need GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving pragma to derive Enum
newtype MaxBoundLessLikely a = MaxLessLikely {</p>

<pre><code>getValue :: a } deriving (Bounded, Eq, Enum, Show)
</code></pre>

<p>instance (Enum a, Eq a, Bounded a) => Random (MaxBoundLessLikely a) where</p>

<pre><code>randomR (a,b) g = case enumRandomR (a,b) g of
    result@(MaxLessLikely value, g') -&gt; 
         if value == maxBound then
             enumRandomR (a,b) g'
         else result
random g = randomR (minBound, maxBound) g
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Your <code>rollDice</code> function then looks so inconspicuous, your opponent might not even notice:</p>

<p>``` haskell
data Player = Me | Opponent</p>

<p>rollDice Me = getRandom
rollDice Opponent = fmap getValue getRandom</p>

<p>howManySixes :: MonadRandom m => Player &ndash;> Int &ndash;> m Int
howManySixes player nrThrows = do</p>

<pre><code>results &lt;- replicateM nrThrows (rollDice player)
return $ length . filter (== Six) $ results
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>They might actually think that they are just unlucky:</p>

<p><code>haskell
λ&gt; howManySixes Me 1000
170
λ&gt; howManySixes Opponent 1000
46
</code></p>

    <updated>2015-09-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://sleepomeno.github.io/blog/2015/09/13/Toying-with-Racket</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2 hours to go&#x2026; I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the men&rsquo;s tennis US Open final
to start. What should I do? In the end, I&rsquo;ve been killing time listening to <a href="http://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-24-matthew-flatt/" target="_blank">that</a> Functional Geekery podcast episode
which features Matthew Flatt talking about the <a href="http://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">Racket</a> programming
language. Realizing the irony, my thoughts went something like: &ldquo;Racket, tennis?! Can&rsquo;t be a coincidence! Still
some time to burn, so I will programm something tennis-like in
Racket!&rdquo; So let&rsquo;s open the Racket <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/" target="_blank">quickstart</a> to somehow learn Racket
and get an idea what the tennis-like thing should be.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="/images/court.png" width="200"></p>

<p>The idea came instantly when I saw that Racket offers quite
newbie-friendly picture drawing examples in its tutorial. Now, it&rsquo;s
obvious what I would do, isn&rsquo;t it? Exactly, I would draw a tennis
court! So I <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">downloaded</a> Racket and found the executable
for the Racket IDE DrRacket in the <strong>bin</strong> folder of the resulting
directory. Given the examples of the <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/" target="_blank">quickstart</a> tutorial I could come
up with that code which got the job done. And it even has (kind of) the blue
color of the US Open hard court ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, now the final is about to start, so only a few impressions of
using Racket for the first time: DrRacket proved easy to use and the
<a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/pict/Basic_Pict_Constructors.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> made it easy to find the right functions for drawing. It
was quite pleasant to see that I could get things done in Racket even
under severe time pressure ;)</p>

<p>Go, Federer!</p>

    <link href="http://sleepomeno.github.io/blog/2015/09/08/Historical-ELO-Tennis-Rating/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://sleepomeno.github.io/blog/2015/09/08/Historical-ELO-Tennis-Rating</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve come across <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-and-the-difference-between-all-time-great-and-greatest-of-all-time/" target="_blank">that fivethirtyeight article</a> comparing the
female tennis all-time greats by means of an  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">Elo rating variant</a> (originally known from chess). It concludes that Serena Williams does
<strong>not</strong> have the highest rating in history, although she is frequently
considered as the greatest player of all time nowadays. Obviously, I
wondered what&rsquo;s the situation like in the men&rsquo;s tennis world. Have
Roger Federer&rsquo;s record 17 Grand Slam wins led to the highest Elo
rating as well? What about players like Borg and McEnroe? Anyway, I
have found surprising results.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Technical approach</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp" target="_blank">This</a> is where I got the match data on ATP matches from 1968
onwards providing the source of the Elo evaluation in yearly CSV
files. I have adopted the mathematical details of the computation from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details" target="_blank">the Elo rating Wikipedia page</a>, while I took the recommendation for the
computation of the <strong>K-factor</strong> from <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-and-the-difference-between-all-time-great-and-greatest-of-all-time/#fn-3" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a>. In addition, I
valued Grand Slam tournament matches higher than other matches
(because of the longer and more challenging best-of-5-sets distance) by
increasing the rating changes resulting from those matches by 10%.
Anyway, I wrote an R script which can be found <a href="https://github.com/sleepomeno/tennis_atp/blob/master/examples/elo.R" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The top 10 highest tennis Elo ratings</h2>

<p>Obviously, the main question is: Who has acquired the highest Elo
rating? The answer is: <span class="underline">Novak Djokovic</span> in May 2015! That&rsquo;s the top 10:</p>

<table class="stat"><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Rating</th><th>Player</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr><td>1</td><td>2335</td><td>Novak Djokovic</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>2310</td><td>Bjorn Borg</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>2304</td><td>John McEnroe</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>2274</td><td>Rafael Nadal</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>2254</td><td>Roger Federer</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>2253</td><td>Ivan Lendl</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>2191</td><td>Jimmy Connors</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>2168</td><td>Boris Becker</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>2159</td><td>Andy Murray</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>2132</td><td>Pete Sampras</td></tr></tbody></table>


<p>Interesting to see that Borg, McEnroe and Lendl (dominating the 1980s) rank in between the likes of
Djokovic, Nadal and Federer who have dominated the last decade.</p>

<p>Anyway, you might be surprised to see 14-time Grand Slam winner Pete
Sampras only in 10th place. In my opinion, his case demonstrates a <strong>practical</strong>
requirement to get to the top of the above list &ndash; or rather
a lack thereof: High-ranked opponents.</p>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>Everything is relative &ndash; being the best, too!?</h2>

<p>No matter how good a professional tennis player you are, you will lose
sooner or later &ldquo;because you are human&rdquo; (this is obviously
controversial and Elo does not account for this). When the defeat happens it is
better to lose against higher Elo-rated opponents since you then lose
less points. To put it bluntly: When you have an hypothetical Elo advantage of 1000
points with regard to the next-best player at the start of the season and you win
99 of 100 matches, you will most likely have a worse rating in the end
of that wonderful season due to that one devastating loss!
Consequently, it could be said that Sampras might have lacked high-valued contemporaries to
make an even deeper run. In contrast, Djokovic has benefited from the
high ratings of Nadal and Federer to get to the very top. (Apart from
that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Ratings_inflation_and_deflation" target="_blank">Elo inflation</a> might be a reason for higher ratings nowadays, too.) Similarly,
Borg, McEnroe and Lendl have benefited from the strong competition in
boosting their respective peaks. That&rsquo;s why I have looked for a way to
abstract the performance from absolute ratings: I have compared the
margins that the above best players could amass in comparison to the
next-best player at their ratings' peaks. Thus, it can be analyzed by
what margin a player has been able to set oneself apart from the
competition, which I consider as an indicator as significant as the
maximal Elo rating.</p>

<table class="stat"><thead><tr><th>Gap</th><th>Player</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr><td>225</td><td>Roger Federer</td></tr> <tr><td>194</td><td>Ivan Lendl</td></tr> <tr><td>181</td><td>Bjorn Borg</td></tr> <tr><td>172</td><td>Novak Djokovic</td></tr> <tr><td>154</td><td>Pete Sampras</td></tr> <tr><td>148</td><td>John McEnroe</td></tr> <tr><td>61</td><td>Rafael Nadal</td></tr> </tbody></table>


<p>In February 2007 Federer reached his rating peak and the next-best
player at that time, Rafael Nadal, trailed 225 Elo points. That event
has marked the biggest gap of the Elo rating&rsquo;s leader and the rest
of the world; a difference of 225 Elo points means a winning chance of
78% for the higher-ranked player. Well, two months later Federer lost to Nadal in the 2007 French
Open final, nevertheless.</p>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>No matter whether you &lsquo;prefer&rsquo; the first or the second table &ndash; both
tables shows the current top players count among the best of all
times, however, they don&rsquo;t really outperform the likes of Borg,
McEnroe and Lendl! The R source code for my analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/sleepomeno/tennis_atp/blob/master/examples/elo.R" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <updated>2015-03-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://sleepomeno.github.io/blog/2015/03/14/Approximating-PI-with-PureScript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh, it is Pi day! To be honest, I had not known about it until today
but it somehow made it into my Twitter stream. Well, after some relaxed Saturday morning browsing I stumbled across the <a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons/" target="_blank">Wolfram Pi approximation demonstration</a>. It looks like this:</p>

<script type='text/javascript' src='http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/javascript/embed.js' ></script>


<script type='text/javascript'>var demoObj = new DEMOEMBED(); demoObj.run('ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons', '', '389', '613');</script>


<div id='DEMO_ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons'><a class='demonstrationHyperlink' href='http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons/' target='_blank'>Approximating Pi with Inscribed Polygons</a> from the <a class='demonstrationHyperlink' href='http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/' target='_blank'>Wolfram Demonstrations Project</a> by Rob Morris</div>


<br />


<p>Pi is approximated by computing the area of the inscribed
polygon and by dividing that area by the square of the circle radius &ndash;
after all, the area of a circle is <strong>r²π</strong>. Obviously, that idea is
that beautiful and so simple that Pi has thus been approximated thousands of
years ago (of course, there are many better and faster ways!), so
I decided to implement it myself.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>PureScript</h2>

<p>Some days ago I stumbled across <strong>PureScript</strong> which compiles to
JavaScript. It is heavily influenced by Haskell and shares its quality
of static typing. However, it has been designed to target JavaScript
from the getgo such that it incorporates the strict evaluation
semantics of JavaScript. In addition, it provides a syntax similar to
native JavaScript for accessing object properties. Given some Haskell knowledge,
PureScript seems to be a decent alternative to Fay or Haste for
creating Javascript code! So I thought I would give
it a try and implement something similar to the above Wolfram
demonstration! So this is the result I accomplished after one day&rsquo;s
work on a <a href="http://sleepomeno.github.io/pi/html/index.html" target="_blank">PureScript clone</a>:</p>

<iframe src="http://sleepomeno.github.io/pi/html/index.html" width="500" height="720" style="margin:auto;display:block"></iframe>


<h3>PureScript learning resources</h3>

<p>First of all these are the best resources on PureScript development that I found:</p>

<ul><li>

<a href="https://gist.github.com/paf31/8e9177b20ee920480fbc" target="_blank">24 days of PureScript</a>

</li><li>

<a href="https://leanpub.com/purescript" target="_blank">PureScript by Example</a> - very detailed but excellent!

</li><li>

<a href="https://github.com/purescript/purescript/wiki" target="_blank">PureScript Wiki</a> 

</li></ul>


<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/paf31/8e9177b20ee920480fbc" target="_blank">24 days of PureScript</a> gives a very good overview of the PureScript
library landscape. Above all, running code for every introduced
library is given which is crucial to getting quickly started. In
addition, there is a project called <a href="http://pursuit.purescript.org/" target="_blank">Pursuit</a> which provides a search
engine for functions of PureScript packages. It is still far from
being as useful as Hoogle or Hayoo for Haskell development, though.</p>

<h2>PureScript libraries and building process</h2>

<p>PureScript libraries are managed by <strong>bower</strong> which has worked
surprisingly well for me. However, at the beginning I had problems getting the interpreter <code>psci</code> running with
all dependencies as I&rsquo;m not used to <strong>grunt</strong> (and <strong>npm</strong>) which are
typically needed in the whole building process. Anyway, when I decided
to use certain PureScript libraries for my implementation their
integration worked like a charm!</p>

<h2>HTML5 Canvas bindings</h2>

<p>PureScript has very decent wrappers of the HTML5 Canvas API in form
of <code>purescript-canvas</code> and <code>purescript-free-canvas</code>. Obviously, I made
heavy use of those to get the circle and the polygon drawn.</p>

<p>``` haskell
center = { x : 210, y : 210 }
drawCircle = do</p>

<pre><code>arc { x: center.x, y: center.y, r: radius, start: 0, end: Math.pi * 2 }
setFillStyle "#000000"
fill
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As an argument to <code>arc</code> we actually have an example of the <em>Object</em>
syntax of PureScript which is just like native JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Angular, React or something else?</h2>

<p>PureScript does have bindings to AngularJS and React (find PureScript
libraries by <a href="http://bower.io/search/?q=purescript" target="_blank">searching bower</a>), however, they are both still
experimental and alpha. So I somehow didn&rsquo;t want to commit to something
half-working which could be very hard to understand for a PureScript
newbie like me. Anyway, I decided that the JQuery binding of
<code>purescript-jquery</code> should be enough for my Pi approximation application; in the end, I
also used <code>purescript-rx</code> (also mentioned on <a href="https://gist.github.com/paf31/8e9177b20ee920480fbc" target="_blank">24 days of PureScript)</a>
but I only scratched the surface of reactive PureScript UI modelling.</p>

<h2>What about the slider?</h2>

<p>I definitely wanted a fancy slider for setting the number of vertices
of the polygon like in the Wolfram demo &ndash; without
too much ado, I immediately decided on using the vanilla <a href="http://jqueryui.com/slider/" target="_blank">JQuery-UI
slider</a>. Copy-Paste. That however means that my PureScript has to
somehow interact with the native slider JavaScript.</p>

<h2>The main function</h2>

<p>The first few lines are about getting representations of the HTML
elements with <code>purescript-jquery</code>. Then I define event handlers for
changing the number of vertices and for toggling the checkbox to
show/hide the triangles. <code>onAsObservable</code> actually is from the
<code>purescript-rx</code> binding to the reactive <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS" target="_blank">RxJS</a> libraries which could be
used to define complex event handling.</p>

<p>``` haskell
main = do</p>

<pre><code>canvas &lt;- getCanvasElementById "canvas"
context &lt;- getContext2D canvas
verticesInput &lt;- select "#vertices"
polygonArea &lt;- select "#polygonArea"
pi &lt;- select "#pi"
triangles &lt;- select "#triangles"

let updateUI num showTriangles = do 
        { pArea : polygonAreaPercent, pi : piApprox } &lt;- showPolygon canvas context num showTriangles
        setText (show polygonAreaPercent &lt;&gt; "%") polygonArea
        setText (show piApprox) pi
let updateUI' = do 
            showTriangles &lt;- ((== "true") &lt;&lt;&lt; stringify) &lt;$&gt; getProp "checked" triangles
            num &lt;- (stringify &gt;&gt;&gt; readInt 10) &lt;$&gt; getValue verticesInput
            updateUI num showTriangles

trianglesChange &lt;- "click" `onAsObservable` triangles
trianglesChange `subscribe` \_ -&gt; void updateUI'

verticesChange &lt;- "focus" `onAsObservable` verticesInput
verticesChange `subscribe` \_ -&gt; void updateUI'

updateUI defaultVertices defaultShowTriangles
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>The Foreign Function Interface</h2>

<p>In the above code I accessed the current value of the checkbox and the
slider value with the <code>purescript-jquery</code> functions <code>getValue</code> and
<code>getProp</code>. However, it was surprisingly difficult to use those values
as they were not of type <code>String</code> but <code>Foreign</code> and I got those
dragged into the field of the Foreign Function Interface for
communicating with JavaScript code. Anyway, after some digging in I
ended up writing the function <code>stringify</code> which trivially transforms the
incoming Javascript value to a <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>``` haskell
foreign import stringify</p>

<pre><code>"function stringify(x) {\
\  return x+\"\";\
\}" :: Foreign -&gt; String
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an example of how you can integrate JavaScript functions in
PureScript. It is a little bit of a joke as of now sice you need to add all
those backslashes, however, things might get easier in case PureScript
gets a meta programming facility like <strong>TemplateHaskell</strong> in the Haskell
world in the future.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>All in all, PureScript really makes a nice impression. There is already
a surprising number of libraries available; decent, mature bindings to
Angular or React would be crucial for getting easy web development
adoption, though. Meta programming integration of JavaScript code would
also prove very nice as would be Source Map support&#x2026; anyway, I&rsquo;m
looking forward to using it again and might get into improving it myself.</p>

<p>PS: You find the code for the PureScript application on <a href="https://github.com/sleepomeno/InscribePolygons" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve not been too exposed to statistics programming in the last few
year, however, sometimes it couldn&rsquo;t be avoided &ndash; and R couldn&rsquo;t be
avoided! (I still have too much self-esteem to think about
falling back to Excel, even for the simplest things.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hate R and I don&rsquo;t like R; it just strikes me as very
<strong>strange</strong>. Often, the syntax strikes me as odd and above all, the
multitude of ways to express the same thing reminds of my little Perl
experience. Anyway, I have subscribed to the Coursera R course for fun
and in hope to somehow &ldquo;get the better of R&rdquo;, to grok in on a deep
level or to at least get a more profound idea as to why I don&rsquo;t like it ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, here is a language construct which is very <strong>strange</strong> and a
little bit absurd, no whatever how often I think about it. It&rsquo;s called
<span class="underline">partial matching</span>. To put it bluntly, partial matching makes it
possible to avoid spelling out the whole name of an element of a list
in oder to access it. Let&rsquo;s have a look.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><code>r
x &lt;- list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5)
</code></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s access <code>a_is_the_first_letter</code>! That&rsquo;s the normal way:</p>

<p>``` r
x$a_is_the_first_letter</p>

<h1>1 2 3 4 5</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>However, you could make your life a lot &ldquo;easier&rdquo;:</p>

<p>``` r
x$a</p>

<h1>1 2 3 4 5</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Well, the crucial question is: what happens if the prefix of your
partial matching is not unique?</p>

<p>``` r
x &lt;&ndash; list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5,</p>

<pre><code>                a_is_my_first_letter_too = 6 : 10)
</code></pre>

<p>x$a</p>

<h1>NULL</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The result is <code>NULL</code>!</p>

<p>``` r
x &lt;&ndash; list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5,</p>

<pre><code>                a_is_my_first_letter_too = 6 : 10)
</code></pre>

<p>x$a_is_m</p>

<h1>6 7 8 9 10</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Here the prefix is unique again. Hooray!</p>

<p>Funny, isn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t like it, though. Why? Because it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;obvious&rsquo;.
You need to know that feature beforehand, otherwise the fact that an
accidentally misspelled field is handled the same way as a non-unique
field prefix (both returning <code>NULL</code>) is awkward, to say the least.
It&rsquo;s nearly as though I said to the R interpreter: &lsquo;Give me field
xy or any field that is somehow similar&#x2026; or just do what you fucking
want (= return NULL)!&rsquo; Anyway, it introduces complexity and indeterminism into the code.</p>

<p>There is another twist to partial matching. Of course, there is more
than one way to access a field of a list. Making use of the double bracket
syntax, that feature of partial matching is handled differently.</p>

<p>``` r
x &lt;&ndash; list(a_is_the_first_letter = 1 : 5)
x[[&ldquo;a&rdquo;]]</p>

<h1>NULL</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Using the double bracket field accessing method, partial matching is
not the default. But R is perly so you still have a way to get that
behavior in a different way:</p>

<p>``` r
x[[&ldquo;a&rdquo;, exact = FALSE]]</p>

<h1>1 2 3 4 5</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>At least I now have a better idea why I don&rsquo;t really like R. It
introduces a sort of laisser-faire programming which I consider too
&ldquo;inexact&rdquo;. I mean, would you really want something like the following to be the
future of programming:</p>

<p>``` java
interface God {</p>

<pre><code>    void killMankind();
    void keepUpTheGoodWork();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>// &hellip;
god.k() // What the hell happens? Who cares.
```</p>
